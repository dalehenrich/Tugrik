# Tugrik

## 100 mongo = 1tugrik

Tugrik is based on the Mongo-Core package of the [MongoTalk project][1]. Tugrik makes it possible to use the Mongo smalltalk API to store objects in a [GemStone/S 64][3] using [GsDevKit_home][2]. 
The obvious advantage is that instead of storing your domain objects in an opaque db like [Mongo][4], your Smalltalk objects are stored in a Smalltalk db and operations can be performed in-place in the GmeStone/S 64 db.
